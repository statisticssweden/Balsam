## Description

The rapid digitalisation of society means that the data ecosystem is continuously expanded with new data sources. In order to process and analyze these, new data hubs are needed that provide support for ensuring that processing of data can be done in a secure and quality-assured way and at the same time enables several actors to collaborate within the data lab. By building on well-established, open initiatives, the project will deliver a base platform for processing and analysis that can be used as a template to quickly establish new data labs.

This projekt is co-funded by VINNOVA and is a co-venture with ORU, AI Sweden and Statistics Sweden.
